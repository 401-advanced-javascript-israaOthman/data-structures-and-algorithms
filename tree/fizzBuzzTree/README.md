# Fizz Buzz Tree 

## Challenge
I will write a function that takes a tree as parameter and make a copy of it but replace the numbers that are divisible by 3 with Fizz and the numbers are divisible by 5 with Buzz
In case both works replace with FizzBuzz  



## Approach & Efficiency
- I used  functions and if statments 
- Big O : 
     - space --> O(n) because I created a new tree
     - time --> O(n) I go thro all the nodes in the tree
