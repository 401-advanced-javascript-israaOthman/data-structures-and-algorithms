# llMerge

## Challenge
   
  Write a function takes two linked lists as an arguments and merge them
  Return the new linked list

## Approach & Efficiency 
- I used while loop
- And if statment 
- Big O : 
     - space --> O(n) because it returns a new linked list so it will take n space in memory 
     - time --> O(n) becase I used for loop to iterate each time I add new node to the list
